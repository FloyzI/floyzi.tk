gui_localization_faq_desc,"- Create a new folder with the desired language code in the Localization folder (refer to language-codes.csv in the assets if needed).\n- Duplicate ""locale.csv"" from existing localization folder and place it into your new folder.\n- Open ""locale.csv"" via any CSV editor and change anything you want.\n- Once done, save your changes in UTF-8 encoding (should be set by default setting).\n- To use your localization with game, specify the folder name for ""Localization File Name"" in the config or use the {loaderName} GUI.\n- If you want to translate config descriptions and credits, copy specific files for them (credits.txt and config-descs.txt) from existing localization and put them in your localization folder after that translate them same way.\n- Feel free to submit your translations on the {loaderName} Discord server. Most likely they will be included with the mod in next updates."
